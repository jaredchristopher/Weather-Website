# Weather-Website

Group: Jared Christopher, Jayme Greer, Joseph Haenel, & Siddartha Reddy

Goals:  This project was created at the SIUE Ehacks Hackathon over the span of a weekend.

GAIA Despcription:  GAIA is a user-friendly website that integrates real-time weather data for a provided city of interest by utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API. Our team's goal was to also try to implement a social media factor of the website so that users could post photos of the weather in their area; however, we were unable to implement this portion of the website given the time limit. Overall, this website is a proof of concept in which users could post photos of the weather around them, view the weather from locations all around the world, and utilize links to various buisnesses that allowed users to book flights and hotels to places they want to visit.

The goal of GAIA is to encourage users to travel and connect with others from around the world as well as with the environment.

File Explaination:  The 'GAIA Ehacks-Project' folder provides all necessary files and images that are used to allow the website to run and be displayed as intended.
